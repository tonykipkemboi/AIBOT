# Whisper x ChatGPT App

A Streamlit web application that allows users to record audio and have a conversation with OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. The app uses PyAudio to record audio, OpenAI's API to transcribe audio to text, and the GPT-3 language model to generate responses.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to install the required packages. You can do this by running:

```pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed the required packages, you can run the app by running:

```streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

To use the app, simply click the "Record" button and start speaking. The app will record your audio and transcribe it to text using OpenAI's API. It will then generate a response using the GPT-3 language model and display it on the screen. The app also includes a text-to-speech feature that can read the response aloud.
